CodeWatcher is a GitHub Actions bot that performs security-focused code reviews on pull requests using static analysis tools with a mentor/red-team approach.

## Features

- **Automated Security Reviews**: Runs pylint, bandit, and semgrep on every PR
- **In-line Comments**: Provides contextual feedback directly on code changes
- **Mentor Mode**: Offers constructive suggestions for code quality improvements
- **Red Team Mode**: Highlights security vulnerabilities with attack scenarios
- **SARIF Integration**: Uploads findings to GitHub's code scanning interface

## How It Works

CodeWatcher automatically:
1. Triggers on pull request events
2. Analyzes changed Python files using multiple static analysis tools
3. Posts in-line comments with security insights and improvement suggestions
4. Provides a summary of findings in the PR conversation

## Installation

1. Add the workflow file to your repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   curl -o .github/workflows/codewatcher.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/CodeWatcher/main/.github/workflows/codewatcher.yml
   ```
